# avatar-rock-paper-scissors
This project is a Python game inspired by elemental battles from a childhood show, using rock–paper–scissors mechanics. Players select elements with strengths and weaknesses, and the program uses conditional logic to determine outcomes. It demonstrates control flow, user input handling, and interactive gameplay.
